    <p>Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an educational simulation and/or academic competition in which students can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves and teaches researching, public speaking, debating, and writing skills, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. Usually an extracurricular activity, some schools also offer MUN as a class.</p>
    <p>Participants in Model UN conferences, known as delegates, are placed in committees and assigned countries, or occasionally other organizations or political figures, where they represent members of that body. They are presented with their assignments in advance, along with a topic or topics that their committee will discuss. Delegates conduct research before conferences and formulate positions that they will then debate with their fellow delegates in the committee, staying true to the actual position of the member they represent. At the end of a conference, the best-performing delegates in each committee, as well as delegations, are sometimes recognized with awards.</p>
    <p>Model UN participants include students at middle school, high school, and college/university levels, with most conferences catering to just one of these three levels (high school and college conferences being most common). Delegates usually attend conferences together as delegations sent by their respective schools' or universities' Model UN clubs, though some delegates attend conferences independently.</p>

    <h2><b>Secretary General's Message</b></h2>
    </div>
    <p text-align="justify">The word LITMUN fills me with eternal gratitude. LITMUN was my first step in the world of MUNs. Started in 2016 by Akshay Raje, as a small attempt to encourage the concept of MUN in Nagpur,
LITMUN has grown to become one of the finest MUNs of central India. I’m delightfully honoured to present you the 3 rd edition of Laxminarayan Institute of Technology Model United Nations the LITMUN’18 to be held on 1 st and 2 nd of September 2018, a legacy passed to me by Mohit Chavan (Secretary General, LITMUN’17). At LITMUN we stimulate a wonderful replica of UN giving our delegates an environment where they can be true diplomats for entire two days. The agendas of our committees are so chosen that they are apt to the current world and well suited not only for first timers but also for the experienced ones. Executive Board that comes to LITMUN is well acquainted with the topic and are extremely supportive and nurturing. All this combines to yield a fulfilling and
enlightening experience for any MUNer. I strongly believe from the very beginning of the human civilization the world has been the ground of political chaos. If we closely look at the past and make a detail analysis of the situation, one comes across the fact that most of the world’s crisis could have been avoided if means of diplomacy and consensus were adopted. Same applies in today’s world. India the country which produced leaders like Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and many others is now struggling to free itself from the clutches of corruption and political unrest. This is because today’s youth is misguided and kept aloof from the reality. I personally feel if the youth is aware of happenings of Indian politics and that of the world and could understand and interpret their causes and consequences we can all make this world a politically stable place. To ensure
political stability and maintain peace the UN was founded. What better place could anyone provide other than a Model United Nations to polish ones diplomatic skills? And what better MUN could anyone find other than LITMUN to experience a MUN in its richest and purest forms? <p>So I, the Secretary General, LITMUN’18 invite you all to come and join us in this wonderful journey on 1st and 2nd of September 2018.</p>
<p>Till then keep muning !!!</p>
    <p>Yours diplomatically,</p>
    <p>

    <p text-align="justify"><i>“More than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations.”</i></p>
    <p>-Kofi Annan</p>
     <p>The world has changed its course in politics many times. Foreign policies of nations have taken steep turns, enemies have become allies and allies have become enemies. However, as Kofi Annan beautifully said that our final destiny is same. History will testify that our interdependence only increases with time. It is easy to adopt and enact “beggar be thy neighbour” policies. In fact, many countries have adopted this system. What is tough is to act in a manner in which everybody’s interests are been taken care of. And in such situations what should be the role of our young minds, the probable leaders of tomorrow? It is now time to find the hidden diplomat under us. I am proud to present you the 3rd edition of LITMUN 2018 as the Director General. I welcome you all to experience two days of diplomacy, debate and discussion at one of the elite MUNs “LITMUN 2018” to be held on 1st & 2nd September 2018.</p>
    <p>Yours Graciously,</p>
